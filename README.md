# Screencast: Encryption with the Go SDK

This repository holds code used in the Temporal Screencast: Encryption with the Go SDK.

If you'd like to easily follow along, or play with some of the example we use, you can use the Gitpod.io button below. This will launch a Gitpod session with the Temporal server running, just like that in the screencast.
